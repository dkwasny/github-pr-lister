Github PR Lister
================
An app that will display PR lists I can't reproduce with the Github web UI by using the Github JSON API.<br />
Is also a place for me to learn Javascript, so I'm doing silly stuff like creating a crappy web server using only Node's base libraries.

How to Run
----------
1. Run `npm install`.
2. Create your own `config/secrets.json` file.
3. Run `npm run server`.
4. Hit `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.
